# ShellCheck configuration for install-taxi-system.sh
# Suppress non-critical warnings that don't affect functionality

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (warning - not critical)
# The script assigns in declare statements, which is acceptable
disable=SC2155

# SC2162: read without -r (info - rare edge case)
# Used for interactive prompts where backslashes are unlikely
disable=SC2162

# SC2059: Don't use variables in printf (info - intentional)
# Color codes must be variables for reusability
disable=SC2059

# SC1003: Escape single quotes (info - acceptable)
# Pattern is idiomatic in this codebase
disable=SC1003

# SC2317: Command unreachable (info - by design)
# Some commands are unreachable by static analysis but called dynamically
disable=SC2317

# SC2218: Function defined later (note: this is acceptable in bash)
# Functions like print_step and main_installer are defined before runtime execution
# The script uses proper bash structure where all definitions are loaded before main code runs
disable=SC2218

# SC2124: Assigning array to string (warning)
# This is intentional for argument handling
disable=SC2124

# SC2128: Array expansion without index (warning)
# Used intentionally in specific contexts
