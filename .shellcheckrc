# Suppress non-critical warnings that don't affect functionality

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (warning - not critical)
# The script assigns in declare statements, which is acceptable
disable=SC2155

# SC2162: read without -r (info - rare edge case)
# Used for interactive prompts where backslashes are unlikely
disable=SC2162

# SC2059: Don't use variables in printf (info - intentional)
# Color codes must be variables for reusability
disable=SC2059

# SC1003: Escape single quotes (info - acceptable)
# Pattern is idiomatic in this codebase

# SC2317: Command unreachable (info - by design)
# Some commands are unreachable by static analysis but called dynamically

# SC2218: Function defined later (REMOVED - this is a REAL error)
# See SHELLCHECK_SC2218_ANALYSIS.md for detailed analysis
# Functions ARE called before being fully defined in this 7,742 line script
# This requires architectural fix: wrapping executable code in main() function
# Cannot be suppressed - it indicates real code structure problems

# SC2124: Assigning array to string (warning)
# This is intentional for argument handling
disable=SC2124

# SC2128: Array expansion without index (warning)
# Used intentionally in specific contexts
